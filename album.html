            Stadium Arcadium is the ninth studio album by American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers. It was released on May 9, 2006, on Warner Bros. Records.[1] It produced five singles: "Dani California",
             "Tell Me Baby", "Snow (Hey Oh)", "Desecration Smile" and "Hump de Bump", along with the first-ever fan-made music video for the song "Charlie". In the United States, Stadium Arcadium became 
             the band's first number-one album. Stadium Arcadium was originally scheduled to be a trilogy of albums each released six months apart, but was eventually condensed into a double album.[2] 
             It was the group's last to feature guitarist John Frusciante before his departure in 2009 and return in 2019.

            The album was praised for integrating musical styles from several aspects of the band's career.[3][4] The album gained the band seven Grammy Award nominations in 2007 including an award for 
            Best Rock Album and one for Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package. Winning five out of seven Grammy Awards, it was the most nominations that the band had garnered in its 24-year career. 
            Kiedis attributed the album's success to less abrasive dynamics within the band, saying that the band's "chemistry, when it comes to writing, is better than ever. There was always a struggle to 
            dominate lyrically. But we are now confident enough in who we are, so everybody feels more comfortable contributing more and more valuable, quality stuff."[5]

                After the release of the band's previous album, By the Way, the Red Hot Chili Peppers embarked on a world tour, from July 2002 to a mid-June 2004 date at London's Hyde Park.[6] The band later 
                appeared at the 2004 Democratic National Convention[7] and at Rock am Ring to tie up their tour in support of By the Way. The band then settled down to begin recording its next album in September 
                2004 with producer Rick Rubin, with whom the band had recorded its previous four albums.[8]
